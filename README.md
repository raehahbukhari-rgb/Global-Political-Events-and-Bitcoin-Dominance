Global Political Events and Bitcoin Market Dominance Dynamics
Overview

This project studies how global political events affect Bitcoin’s market dominance — the percentage of the total crypto market value that comes from Bitcoin.
When political situations change, investors often adjust their risk behavior. I want to see if political instability or uncertainty makes people move their money toward Bitcoin, and how that changes the balance between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.

Motivation

I follow crypto trading and often notice that during wars, sanctions, or elections, Bitcoin becomes stronger compared to other coins. My idea is to check if these changes are random or if there is a clear pattern between world politics and Bitcoin’s dominance. If the connection exists, it might explain how investors react to global uncertainty and what kind of “safe zone” Bitcoin provides in such times.

Data

Bitcoin and total crypto market data: Market cap, dominance percentage, and volume from the CoinGecko API
.

Political events data: Timeline of international political events from GDELT Project
 or Wikipedia events data
.


Plan and Methods

Collect and clean crypto and political event data.

Match event dates with Bitcoin dominance records.

Create visuals showing how dominance changes before and after major events.

Use correlation and hypothesis testing to see if instability raises Bitcoin dominance.

Later, try a small regression model to estimate dominance changes based on event frequency or sentiment.
Expected Result

I expect that during politically unstable times, Bitcoin dominance will rise because investors prefer a more stable digital asset. During calmer or optimistic periods, dominance may fall as people move to altcoins seeking higher returns.

Limitations

Political event data may not cover every country equally, and Bitcoin dominance is also affected by other factors such as ETF news or major exchange actions. I will mention these points in the final report.
